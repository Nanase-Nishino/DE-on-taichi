# DE-on-taichi
Differential evolution(DE) on taichi and cuda

DE is one kind of evolutionary algorithms that used to solve black-box optimization problem widely.
Examples of ti has not covered evolutionary algorithms which is a field that many researchers concern and interest.
In our code, we prove that the advantage of taichi for evolutionary algorithm which is naturally suitable for parallel computing.
